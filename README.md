# Canny Edge Detector - NI-GPU

## **ðŸ“Œ Project Stages**
The project is structured into the following **four stages**, with each stage contained in a separate directory (`stage-n/`):

### **ðŸ”¹ Stage 1: Sequential Implementation**
- Implement a **basic C++ version** of the Canny Edge Detector.
- Uses **OpenCV** for image I/O but implements edge detection manually.
- Serves as a baseline for further optimizations.

### **ðŸ”¹ Stage 2: Parallel Implementation (GPU)**
- Convert the algorithm to run on **CUDA** for parallel execution.
- Optimize performance by leveraging **GPU processing power**.
- Compare execution time against the sequential version.

### **ðŸ”¹ Stage 3: Benchmarking**
- Measure the performance of **both sequential and parallel implementations**.
- Evaluate speedup factors, memory usage, and compute efficiency.
- Perform tests on **different image sizes** and **varying kernel sizes**.

### **ðŸ”¹ Stage 4: Final Report & Results**
- Summarize findings in a **detailed report**.
- Compare **accuracy, performance, and efficiency**.
- Discuss challenges faced and potential future improvements.
